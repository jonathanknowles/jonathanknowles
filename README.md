# 👋 Hi, I'm Jonathan Knowles

I'm a software engineer and functional programming enthusiast based in **Taiwan**.

I'm passionate about building software that is **reliable** and **correct**.

## 📦 Haskell Packages

I'm the maintainer of several Haskell packages:

### `monoidmap`

The [`monoidmap`](https://github.com/jonathanknowles/monoidmap) package provides the [`MonoidMap`](https://hackage-content.haskell.org/package/monoidmap/docs/Data-MonoidMap.html#g:1) type, which represents a total function from keys to monoidal values with finite support and a default of `mempty`.

There are several complementary packages:

| Package | Description |
|--|--|
| 📦 [`monoidmap`](https://github.com/jonathanknowles/monoidmap) | Provides the core [`MonoidMap`](https://hackage-content.haskell.org/package/monoidmap/docs/Data-MonoidMap.html#g:1) data type and functions. |
| 📦 [`monoidmap-examples`](https://github.com/jonathanknowles/monoidmap-examples) | Provides worked examples of how to use [`MonoidMap`](https://hackage-content.haskell.org/package/monoidmap/docs/Data-MonoidMap.html#g:1). |
| 📦 [`monoidmap-aeson`](https://github.com/jonathanknowles/monoidmap-aeson) | Provides support for JSON encoding with [`aeson`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson). |
| 📦 [`monoidmap-hashable`](https://github.com/jonathanknowles/monoidmap-hashable) | Provides support for in-memory hashing with [`hashable`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hashable). |
| 📦 [`monoidmap-quickcheck`](https://github.com/jonathanknowles/monoidmap-quickcheck) | Provides support for property testing with [`QuickCheck`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck). |
| 📦 [`monoidmap-internal`](https://github.com/jonathanknowles/monoidmap-internal) | Provides low-level internal functions. 🐉  |

### Property Testing

| Package | Description |
|--|--|
| 📦 [`quickcheck-groups`](https://github.com/jonathanknowles/quickcheck-groups) | [`QuickCheck`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) support for the [`groups`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/groups) library. |
| 📦 [`quickcheck-monoid-subclasses`](https://github.com/jonathanknowles/quickcheck-monoid-subclasses) | [`QuickCheck`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) support for the [`monoid-subclasses`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monoid-subclasses) library. |
| 📦 [`quickcheck-quid`](https://github.com/jonathanknowles/quickcheck-quid) | Quasi-unique identifiers for [`QuickCheck`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck). |

### Miscellaneous

| Package | Description |
|--|--|
| 📦 [`bech32`](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/bech32) | Support for the Bech32 encoding standard. |
| 📦 [`haskell-calculator`](https://github.com/jonathanknowles/haskell-calculator) | Functional reactive calculator with expression visualization. |
| 📦 [`haskell-example`](https://github.com/jonathanknowles/haskell-example) | Haskell CI template, ready to fork and go. |
| 📦 [`roc-id`](https://github.com/jonathanknowles/roc-id) | Implementation of the ROC (Taiwan) UID Number (中華民國統一證號) format. |
